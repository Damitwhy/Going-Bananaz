# Welcome Collaborators!

This is the first hackathon project that we're collaborating on. Very excited to have you on board. 

This project is a great opportunity for us to work together and create something amazing whilst testing the skills we've learnt so far.

We're here to have fun and prove, four minds together are better than one.

## Safeguarding

We are committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for all collaborators. We expect everyone to adhere to Code Institute's code of conduct, which includes:

- Respecting each other's ideas and feedback
- Communicating openly and constructively
- Avoiding offensive or discriminatory language
- Reporting any concerns or incidents of misconduct to the project administrators at Code Institute student support.

Please remember that this is a collaborative space where we want everyone to feel welcome and comfortable.

## Celebrating Diversity

We believe that our project is stronger with a diverse team. We celebrate the diversity of our collaborators and believe that our differences make us stronger.

We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard, and where everyone can learn and grow. We encourage everyone to bring their authentic selves to the project.

We understand that learning and growth happen in a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment. We are committed to building this environment and to continually improving our practices to ensure that our project is a place where everyone feels welcome.

We look forward to collaborating with you, learning from you, and creating something amazing together.

## Our Project

Find all our Project details in our-hackathon-details folder, for some reason .pdf files dont seem to work on VSCode so I converted a few into png images just so we have a page to reference when working out our code.

I think I will leave it here for now and wait until we have a our first scrum.

Just discovered to read the pdf files on VSCode get the extension.. vscode-pdf

# HAPPY CODING!!
