                            <h5>Emma's Story</h5>
                            <p>
                                I graduated top of my class with a degree in computer science and secured a job at a
                                prestigious startup known for its cutting-edge projects.

                                The office was predominantly male, and while my colleagues were friendly enough, during
                                meetings, my ideas were often met with polite nods but rarely taken seriously. More
                                frustratingly, when I suggested innovative solutions, my male counterparts would
                                rephrase my ideas and receive praise for them.

                                I had been working tirelessly on a complex algorithm that could potentially
                                revolutionize the company's main product. I presented my findings in a team meeting,
                                laying out my thought process and the potential impact of my work. The room was silent
                                and it wasn't until a male colleague presented my idea, that it was taken seriously and
                                he'd received praise for it.

                                I was stunned. I realized that my contributions were being systematically
                                undervalued because of my gender so I started documenting my work meticulously,
                                sending detailed emails to my manager outlining my contributions and ideas and was
                                able to prove, with documented evidence, that the innovative algorithm driving their
                                success was my creation. The project lead took notice, and I finally received the
                                recognition I deserved.</p>

                            <h5>Alex's Story</h5>
                            <p>
                                I had always been passionate about my job where I worked as a creative director but
                                from my first day, I noticed a subtle chill whenever I mentioned my partner,
                                Michael. Casual conversations about weekend plans would abruptly shift when I brought
                                up my relationship. I tried to brush it off, hoping it was just my imagination, but
                                the snide remarks and exclusion from after-work gatmyings became too frequent to
                                ignore.

                                One day, during a team meeting, I proposed a bold new idea for an ad campaign that
                                celebrated diversity and inclusion. As I spoke, I saw a few colleagues exchange
                                uncomfortable glances. After the meeting, my manager, Tom, pulled me aside. "Alex,
                                maybe you should tone it down a bit. Not everyone is comfortable with these topics," Tom
                                said, his tone dismissive. I felt a wave of frustration and hurt. I realized that
                                my workplace, which prided itself on being forward-thinking and creative, was still
                                mired in outdated prejudices. Determined to fight back, I documented these incidents
                                and sought support from HR, hoping to foster a more inclusive environment where
                                everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, could feel valued and respected.</p>

                            <h5>Maya's Story</h5>
                            <p>I have always been proud of my my heritage and my role as a software engineer at NexTech
                                Innovations. As one of the few women of color in the company, I faced the challenge of
                                proving my worth daily. Despite my stellar performance and innovative solutions, I
                                often found myself sidelined in meetings and overlooked for key projects. My ideas
                                were frequently dismissed, only to be accepted later when reiterated by a white
                                colleague. The most painful incident occurred during a team brainstorming session when
                                a coworker made a disparaging remark about my accent, implying it made me less
                                competent.

                                The breaking point came when a promotion I had been working towards for months was
                                given to someone with less experience but who fit the "company image" better. Feeling
                                marginalized and frustrated, I decided to speak up. I approached HR with detailed
                                records of the biases I had encountered, advocating not just for myself but for the
                                few other minority employees at NexTech. My courage sparked difficult yet necessary
                                conversations within the company, leading to diversity training programs and a renewed
                                commitment to creating an inclusive workplace. My perseverance helped pave the way
                                for a more equitable environment, where all employees had the opportunity to thrive
                                based on their talents and hard work.</p>

                            <p>I have experienced ableism within my working environments. As someone with
                                neurodevelopmental and physical disabilities I am often discriminated against by not
                                receiving the appropriate accomodations for my disabilities often with statements of "so
                                and so has the same issues and they don't need this" or "if we provide this to you
                                everyone will want the same priviledges". Accomodations are not a priviledge, they are a
                                necessity to function and create an equitable environment. Despite my challenges I go on
                                to receive high praise and have accomplished many things people thought impossible.
                                Fight for your right to have the necessary and appropriate accomodations.</p>
